Hi! I'm Nikita and I'm front-end developer in [Mail.ru](https://mail.ru), where I do Mediaprojects better. In my spare time I code for fun and learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)  and backend-related things, such as Docker deploy with CI for example. I also code some secret project. I'm in love with my [Volvo](https://www.drive2.ru/r/volvo/v40_cross_country/480505823865339906/).

I can't count how much blogs I had before this blog appeared. Countless number. But I can say for sure, that I'm no longer interested in big blog posts, because it's easier to write thoughts in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/life_maniac), than spend big amount of time to make really good post. But as soon as I have this blog, I'll give it a try ðŸ™‚.
